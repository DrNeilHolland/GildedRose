Hiring Code for Kalibrate

Winform application written by Neil Holland on 08/11/2017

The application is written in C#
It uses external libraries for NUnit.

The source code can be downloaded from Github at https://github.com/DrNeilHolland/GildedRose
and run in Visual Studio.
Open Visual Studio, then from the menu select File->Open->Project/Solution, 
then navigate to the downloaded solution file GildedRoseItinerary.sln and click OK.
The code must be compiled first, from the menu select Build->Build Solution.
To run the code, select Ctrl+F5, or to debug it just F5.

When it is run, a form will appear showing a text box and a button.
The text box initially shows the input itinerary read from file.
Hitting the button will update the text box to show how the itinerary looks one day later.
The button can be continuously hit again to show the effects of further updates.

Alternatively the unit tests can be run.
From Visual Studio, open the Test Explorer using Test->Windows->Test Explorer.
Then from the Test Explorer click on Run All.
